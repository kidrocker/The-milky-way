# The Milky way

## Libraries used

1. Retrofit and gson - Data fetching from the api. The libraries provide a standard way to fetch, enqueue and parse json into objects.
2. Navigation components - The library simplifies navigation between fragments with animations and safe arguments. Navigation safe args allow us to share data between fragments safely.
3. Glide - Glide provides a simplified lazy loading of images from a network source.
4. Hilt - Dependecy injection simplified. Hilt is preferred as it is simpler to implement than dagger yet as powerful
